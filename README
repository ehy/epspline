EPSPLINE -- WHAT IS IT?

    Epspline is a simple 2D graphical editor for the ``prism'' and
    ``lathe'' objects of the POV-Ray ray-tracer software. It is
    not useful beyond POV-Ray projects (but, if you don't use POV-Ray
    or don't know what it is, see http://www.povray.org/ -- there is
    a good chance you will find it interesting).
    
    Epspline uses the wxWidgets library (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)
    which provides cross-platform portability. At the time of the
    first release, epspline should build and work on MSWindows,
    OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux (Debian and Ubuntu currently
    tested; others should be no problem), OpenSolaris (0609) and
    OpenIndiana. Other systems supported by wxWidgets have not been
    available to the author, and building epspline on those will
    need work. The GTK version of wxWidgets is used on the Unix
    systems mentioned above -- long ago the Motif and universal
    versions of wxWidgets were tried and worked to some extent,
    but they are probably not working now.

STATUS

    Above, epspline was called ``simple'' which is a way of saying
    that there is much more that it could do to be helpful, but
    it should still be much easier than hand editing prisms and lathes.
    Online help documentation is included. The author is not a doc-
    umentation writer, but hopefully the help docs will provide the
    necessary usage information.
    
    Users might find some bugs, but the author has not found any
    catastrophic bugs, such as crashing. One problematic build is
    with the old wxGTK 2.6 on FreeBSD 9.0, from the FreeBSD ports.
    Another is with wx 2.6 on Ubuntu 12.04 (2.6 on Ubuntu 10.04
    worked as expected). In any case, the newer wxWidgets versions
    are be preferable.
    
    Epspline should build against wxWidgets versions 2.6, 2.8, and
    2.9 (and presumably 3.0; 2.9 is a development version toward 3.0).
    Not all versions have been tried on all platforms.
    
    UPDATE: as of the second release of Epspline, version 0.0.4.3,
    wxWidgets 2.6 is no longer supported. Epspline is now using
    classes that first appeared in wxWidgets 2.8. Also, this is
    being written a short time after the release of wxWidgets 3.0.0,
    and Epspline is being developed against that as well as
    wxWidgets 2.8; therefore, every mention of 2.6 above, and of 2.9
    (which is a development version of 3.0), is merely historical.
    Now wxWidgets 3.0.0 has many improvements, prefer it over 2.8 if
    you can, but for the GTK build, prefer GTK2 over GTK3. The GTK3
    build has problems, such as some common graphics operations
    failing to have an effect. Epspline has had a few workarounds
    added for wxGTK3, but its sparkling beauty is not unblemished.
