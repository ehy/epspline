This directory is 'po' in the source release of epspline.

The epspline program is prepared to use the wxWidgets i18n
support.  This directory contains the message catalog template
'epspline.pot', and miscellaneous other files including the
directory 'en_US', and the Makefile.

The Makefile is written to work with directories named for
each locale (rather than *.po files named for each locale),
and file 'epspline.po' in the locale-named directories.
The compiled machine objects are written in those directories,
and the install target tests each directory for epspline.mo,
and if it is a regular file, installs it in:

  $(DATAPREFIX)/share/locale/<locale-named directory>/LC_MESSAGES

See the Makefile for details.
