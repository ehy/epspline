	In this one limited instance we do give permission to use
	the code you mentioned. This is extremely unusual but in
	your case we feel an exception is reasonable.

	You need to acknowledge the use of the code in the source
	and make it entirely clear (to others who may see your use
	and think that it is thus 'ok' to use our source code) that
	it is not allowable under normal circumstances.

	thanks,

Here is the text of my request:

	Hi,

	This is in regard to the POV-Ray license, specifically
	pertaining to use of the POV-Ray source code.

	I am currently working on a spline editor for POV's
	prism and lathe objects.  It is at an early stage, but
	already appears to be potentially useful to POV users.
	It uses the wxWindows library for its graphical interface,
	and wxWindows is now using the well known GNU GPL.

	If I decide to make a public release of this spline editor,
	and I would like to after a little more development, I
	would like to use the GNU GPL.  (Release as source code
	only.)

	Here's the problem: I have used twenty four lines of code
	from POV's prism.c (there is identical code in lathe.c).
	Specifically, in the function Compute_Prism() there is a
	switch() with cases for linear, quadratic, cubic, and
	bezier splines, and each case calculates interpolation
	coefficients for a set of points (or UV vectors).

	Since the point of my spline editor is to work with
	outlines that accurately represent the shape of objects
	that POV will produce, it seemed natural to reuse that
	code, but I am worried that even these few lines would
	violate your license.  In the section ``Permitted
	Modification And Custom Versions'' this prohibition is stated:

	    A "custom version" is defined as a fully functional
	    version of POV-Ray with all existing features intact.
	    ANY OTHER USE OF ANY POV-Ray SOURCE CODE IS
	    EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED. The POV-Team does not license
	    source code for any use outside POV-Ray. No portion
	    of the POV-Ray source code may be incorporated into
	    another program unless it is clearly a custom version
	    of POV-Ray that includes all of the basic functions of POV-Ray. 

	Is an exception possible?  I am looking forward to your reply.

	TIA,
	Ed Hynan
