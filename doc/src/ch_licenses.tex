	This software, with the name \emph{epspline} as of the initial
	release, is licensed under the terms of the \emph{GNU
	General Public License}, optionally Version 2 or a later version.
	The \IXpkg{} documentation (this document) is released under
	the terms of the
	\emph{GNU Free Documentation License} version 1.2.

	Where there are instances in which a specific use of the
	wxWidgets library implies that the
	\href{http://www.wxwidgets.org/about/newlicen.htm}{wxWindows/wxWidgets License}
	should apply, that license does apply.
	As of this writing such instances exist in the files
	\dtyfiles{wxexio.h}, \dtyfiles{wxexio.cpp},
	\dtyfiles{lexer.l}, and \dtyfiles{parser.y},
	all under the directory \dtyfiles{src/}.

	The \IXpkg{} source includes, under the directory
	\dtyfiles{msw\_pkg/}, source for a binary installer program
	generated by the
	\emph{Nullsoft Scriptable Install System} (\emph{NSIS}). Those
	sources are derived from \emph{NSIS} example sources and
	retain the original
	\href{http://nsis.sourceforge.net/License}{license}.
	
	The source file \dtyfiles{src/splines.cpp} uses,
	with permission granted
	by the POV-Team Co-ordinator on 7 April 2000,
	a total of 24 lines of code found in
	the file \dtyfiles{prism.c} of version 3.1 of \IXpov{}.
	The \IXpkg{} source includes, in the  top
	directory, the file
	\dtyfiles{POV\_permission.txt} containing the communication
	in which permission was requested and granted. It must be
	understood that an exception to the (then current) license
	was granted, and that the use of the 24 lines of code in
	\IXpkg{} does not imply that \IXpov{} code use is
	permitted. Please abide by the \IXpov{} licenses at
	\url{http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html} and
	\url{http://www.povray.org/distribution-license.html}.
