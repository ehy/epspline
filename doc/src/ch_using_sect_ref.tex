		\begin{description}
		  \item[Mouse Primary Button Click] \hfill \\
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item Outside the bounds of a selected object, the
		        object is deselected
		      \item Within the bounds of an object, when no object
		        is selected, the object is selected
		      \item Within the bounds of a selected object,
		        if on a control point, selects any the point
		      \item Within the bounds of a selected object,
		        if \emph{not} on a control point,
		        deselects any selected point
		    \end{itemize}
		  \item[Shift Key and Mouse Primary Button Click] \hfill \\
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item When no
		        object is selected, enters edit mode and
		        begins adding points in a
		        new object
		      \item When an
		        object is in edit mode,
		        leaves edit mode
		      \item If an object is selected, and the mouse active
		        point lies on (or very near) a sub-curve, a
		        new point or segment is added to the sub-curve
		      \item If an object is selected, and the mouse active
		        point is \emph{not} near a sub-curve, enters edit mode
		        and begins adding points in a new sub-curve
		    \end{itemize}
		  \item[Mouse Secondary Button Click] \hfill \\
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item When a selected object is in transform mode,
		        leaves transform mode
		      \item When an object is selected but not in
		        transform mode, the object pop-up menu is shown
		      \item When no object is selected,
		        the canvas (drawing area) pop-up menu is shown
		    \end{itemize}
		  \item[Shift Key and Mouse Secondary Button Click] \hfill \\
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item When an object is selected but not in
		        transform mode, enters transform mode
		      \item When a selected object is in transform mode,
		        cycles through scale, shear, and rotate modes
		    \end{itemize}
		  \item[Mouse Primary Button Drag] \hfill \\
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item If mouse active point is on a guide line,
		        guide line is moved, or removed if dragged over
		        corresponding graduated scale
		      \item On a selected control point, the point
		        is moved; with the shift key pressed,
		        may `snap' point to a nearby guide line;
		        in the \dtybeznl{} spline a group of associated
		        points are effected unless control (command)
		        key is depressed
		      \item On a selected object \emph{not}
		        in transform mode,
		        the object is moved; with the shift key
		        pressed, may `snap' an edge (of the bounding
		        box) to a nearby guide line
		      \item On a selected object \emph{in} transform mode,
		        if the mouse active point is within a `handle'
		        or lies on the bounding box, the
		        transform is effected
		    \end{itemize}
		  \item[Backspace and Delete keys] \hfill \\
		    \begin{itemize}
		      \item A selected point is deleted;
		        in the \dtybeznl{} spline the group of
		        points associated with the selected point
		        are deleted and remaining end-points are joined
		      \item A selected object
		        without a selected point is deleted
		    \end{itemize}
