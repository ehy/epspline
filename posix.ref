[March '13 (!)]

In the `README' regarding the Makefiles, POSIX compliance to
a practical degree is asserted.  The reference to ``POSIX'' is
vague because online access to the documents is irregular.  It
might be that different versions have been used at different
times, because when attempting to find the documents at the
Open Group site, hoops must be jumped through.  I usually forget
how to jump the hoops, and will generally take what I can get.
(I _have_ heard of bookmarks.  What are they?)

In any case, the last document used has the following title:

    The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6
    IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition
    Copyright Â© 2001-2004 The IEEE and The Open Group

(Note that in the above there is a UTF-8 copyright [(C)] symbol,
which might not appear correctly if your viewer is not UTF-8 savvy.
If necessary, interpret visual noise as the copyright symbol.)

The URL for the document is:

    http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/
