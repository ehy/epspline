% Epspline Program Documentation: Runtime Help
% Ed Hynan -- Dec 31, 2012

% NOTES:
%	htlatex can be invoked as
%		htlatex epspline.tex "html,index=2,4,sec-filename,charset=UTF-8"
%	and the output is nice, but the output if iso-8859-1, so html must
%	be post-processed with iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t UTF-8 for proper display
%	in browsers; but presently I don't know how well the wxWidgets viewer
%	handles charsets, so leave out ,charset=UTF-8 until further testing.
%

% TIPS, from something used as a starter:
% WARNING!  Do not type any of the following 10 characters except as directed:
%                &   $   #   %   _   {   }   ^   ~   \

%Double quotes are typed like this: ``quoted text''.
%Single quotes are typed like this: `single-quoted text'.
%
%Long dashes are typed as three dash characters---like this.
%
%Emphasized text is typed like this: \emph{this is emphasized}.
%Bold       text is typed like this: \textbf{this is bold}.

%Remember, don't type the 10 special characters (such as dollar sign and
%backslash) except as directed!  The following seven are printed by
%typing a backslash in front of them:  \$  \&  \#  \%  \_  \{  and  \}.
%The manual tells how to make other symbols.

\section{Usage}%WX%3||303000||

\IXpkgu{} is an interactive program with a
graphical interface. Interaction is primarily by use of a mouse
(or any pointing device from which the windowing system delivers
`mouse' events to software).
