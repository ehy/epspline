BUILD and INSTALL
	This file is concerned with the main program. The documentation
	is included both as source and as a pre-built ZIP file, so
	that the ability to build the docs is not required to build
	the program, yet the docs can be built from source if desired
	(see doc/Makefile).
	
	The main dependency for epspline is the wxWidgets library.
	
MSWindows:
	Presently, epspline will build (and work) against wxWidgets 2.8
	with the Digital Mars compiler and STLPort (the cost-free
	download tools). The source includes makefile.dmc and
	src\makefile.dmc which will need to be edited to set the
	paths to the wxWidgets headers and libraries. (Note that the
	DMC tools work well with WINE under GNU/Linux.)
	
	Other native MSW compilers will almost certainly not be able
	to use the DMC makefiles directly, but they might provide a
	guide or starting point for writing makefiles for other tools,
	or even to set up IDE projects. Also, successful compilation
	might require some small source edits.
	
	MinGW builds epspline for MSWindows very nicely under Cygwin
	or a Unix system using the main POSIX Makefiles. This is the
	MSW build most tested by the original author. Unfortunately,
	for someone not accustomed to Unix-like systems, installation
	and use of Cygwin seems like it might be a steep requirement
	(but might prove to be well worth the effort).
	
	Building with MinGW is much like using GCC on a Unix-like
	system (as described below). These are the main points:
	
		* the make target is `mingw' which of course must be
		  given to the make command
		
		* the wxWidgets libraries must be built with MinGW too,
		  of course, and since the `wx-config' script from that
		  is probably not in (or first in) $PATH, it's path must
		  be assigned to the CF macro on the commandline.
		
		* it might important to use the same optimization option
		  building the application that was used building the
		  library (possibly not in all possible cases). The
		  original author has built wxWidgets with -Os -static
		  and found that using -O3 -static for epspline produced
		  many dire warnings. (-Os is fine for epspline.)
		
		* the `install' target is not useful, but `clean',
		`cleandepends', and `cleanall' are
	
	A MinGW make command might look like:
	
		% make CF=$PWD/../wxMSW_2.8.12_unicode_mingw-config \
			CXXFLAGS="-Os -static" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -static" mingw

Unix/POSIX:
	The build is accomplished with Makefiles that are written to
	comply with POSIX.  Whenever possible, system commands invoked
	in the rules, and the options given, are as described in The
	Open Group's online POSIX documentation. It is also necessary
	to invoke commands that are not specified by POSIX; the C++
	compiler is notable among these.

Command to build on OpenSolaris 0609 with SunStudio CC:
time /usr/bin/make CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-xO2 -include vector -include algorithm" WARN= INSTALLCMD=ginstall >&/dev/stdout >&../t-log
Command to build on OpenSolaris 0609 local-built wxWidgets, with GCC g++ (e.g. /usr/sfw/bin/c++):

/usr/bin/make CF=/usr/local/bin/wx-config LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/lib" >&/dev/stdout >&../t-log
