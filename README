EPSPLINE -- WHAT IS IT?

	Epspline is a simple 2D graphical editor for the ``prism'' and
	``lathe'' objects of the POV-Ray ray-tracer software. It is
	not useful beyond POV-Ray projects (but, if you don't use POV-Ray
	or don't know what it is, see http://www.povray.org/ -- there is
	a good chance you will find it interesting).
	
	Epspline uses the wxWidgets library (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)
	which provides cross-platform portability. At the time of the
	first release, epspline should build and work on MSWindows,
	OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux (Debian and Ubuntu currently
	tested; others should be no problem), OpenSolaris (0609) and
	OpenIndiana. Other systems supported by wxWidgets have not been
	available to the author, and building epspline on those will
	need work. The GTK version of wxWidgets is used on the Unix
	systems mentioned above -- long ago the Motif and universal
	versions of wxWidgets were tried and worked to some extent,
	but they are probably not working now.

STATUS

	Above, epspline was called ``simple'' which is a way of saying
	that there is much more that it could do to be helpful, but
	it should still much easier than hand editing prisms and lathes.
	
	Users might find some bugs, but the author has not found any
	catastrophic bugs, such as crashing
