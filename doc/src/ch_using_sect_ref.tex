	This section briefly lists mouse and key
	inputs and their actions, and
	separately, actions and the associated inputs.

	General concepts are not discussed in this section,
	nor is usage discussed in detail. If more explanation
	is needed, go to the beginning of the
	chapter~``\nameref{chap:using_epspline}.''
	If even \IXpov{} is not known, go to
	``\nameref{chap:introduction}.''
	
	The following lists are not ordered (or are in
	arbitrary order).
